# Car Price Prediction Competition  

This repository contains the project developed for the **Car Price Prediction Competition** at Macquarie University. The competition challenged participants to forecast car prices using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques.

## Objective  
The primary goal of this project was to build a robust predictive model to accurately forecast car prices based on the given dataset. Participants were evaluated on their ability to preprocess data, engineer features, and employ advanced regression methodologies.

## Key Components  
1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Ensured dataset accuracy by handling missing values and correcting inconsistencies.  
2. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Constructed and tested new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.  
3. **Model Building:**  
   - Implemented various regression techniques, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.  
4. **Forecasting:**  
   - Used the final model to predict prices for the test dataset.

## Dataset  
- **Training Dataset:** 8,000 entries with 37 variables (features).  
- **Test Dataset:** 4,000 entries with 36 variables (target variable: `price`).  
- The dataset required extensive preprocessing, including exploratory data analysis, missing value imputation, and outlier detection.

## Evaluation  
Ranking were evaluated using **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- Problem Understanding and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Dataset Cleaning and Missing Value Imputation  
- Feature Engineering  
- Advanced Regression Techniques (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)  
- Model Evaluation and Optimization  

## Outcome  
This project secured **third place** in the competition out of nearly 90 teams, highlighting the effectiveness of feature engineering, model selection, and ensemble learning.
